Then one day I happened upon a place with books and quickly taught myself how to read. It was then that I started having my people collect books as they went out hunting. Then soon after that, when I had learned how to operate a computer, I had them bring back computer disks. After a time I came to the conclusion that there may be a way, through science, to raise the intelligence of my people.",
