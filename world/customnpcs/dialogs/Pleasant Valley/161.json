We have been wandering the wastes for years now and built a reputation of being a group to be reckoned with. We all adopted “tough” names to spread fear across the wastes at the mention of us. This was done to protect ourselves. The rumors about our group are wild, far-fetched, and frankly untrue. We are quite worn out and looking to settle. Pleasant Valley looks good and fortified, but because of our reputation, we didn’t think we would be welcomed. So, I started to send my boys into the town to stir up trouble. Minor trouble, but enough to get the citizens infighting enough to allow us to take over. No killing or taking essentials….just little things to spook them and start a riot of sorts.",
