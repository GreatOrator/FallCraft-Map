The project's M.A.R.S. team for this region went rogue. Their leader snapped once he  woke and saw the devestation. He's been holed up in what remains of Colorado Springs to the east and he has control of most of the military. We do not have enough personnel to police the area and train the survivors to defend themselves - although they have been doing a fine job without us - they could benefit from more training and supplies.",
