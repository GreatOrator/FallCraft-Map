Most of us alive now only remember the famines and plague, but my father told me how the darkness came. He would say, \"Men came, carrying guns, for they had nothing and demanded everything. The people from the ice towers refused, saying that they will not negotiate with evil men. They did offer, that should the men live in the towers and destroy their guns, they will never want for anything. The evil men were furious at the offer, and destroyed the towers, and destroyed the ‘Mall.’”",
